				<p>I was just kind of thrown into owning a dog with my buddy Cloud, 9 years ago. I was completely mystified about what to do with this creature pooping all over my apartment and vying for my attention all day long. Like I do with any mystery or challenge, I took it by the horns (leash, in this case?) and faced the painful process of learning by trial and error and networking. Thanks to Cloud, I met more dogs than I ever would without him and gradually gained confidence and knowledge on interacting with our best friends.</p> 

				<p>When I had the opportunity to work for a major dog-walking company, my experience with my own dog got me in the door. I thought it would be a dream job and came in with all kinds of optimism and drive. That was quickly challenged when I realized my long walks with Cloud did not give me the stamina to trek the city on foot for 8 hours with packs of wily pups. But once again, I met the challenge head on and took in everything the experience had to offer for 2 full years.</p>

				<p>With Trailing Tailz, I seek to apply the one lesson that has consistently come up in all my experiences: every dog appreciates a nice walk. And so do I. Of course, it's important to know how to keep a pup healthy, to make sure she's a model citizen in an elevator or at the dog park, to remember to put out the water and keep the chocolate out of reach. I am committed to all of our buddies' well-being as if they were my very own and prepared to take on any challenges that come along the way. But I live for the wagging tail and welcoming bark (occasionally getting the wind knocked out of me by a happy lunge) and that mad rush out the door.
